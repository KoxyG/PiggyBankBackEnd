## Piggy Bank Smart Contract


# Description

The Piggy Bank Smart Contract is a simple Ethereum smart contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether (ETH) in a savings-like manner. Users can deposit funds into the Piggy Bank and later withdraw them when needed. This contract is designed to serve as a basic example of a savings contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Features

- **Deposit Functionality**: Users can deposit Ether into the Piggy Bank by calling the `deposit` function.

- **Withdrawal Functionality**: The contract owner can initiate a withdrawal of all funds from the Piggy Bank using the `withdraw` function.

- **Balance Checking**: Users and the contract owner can check the current balance of the Piggy Bank using the `getBalance` function.

- **Depositor Count**: The contract owner can check the number of depositors using the `getDepositorCount` function.

## Getting Started

To interact with the Piggy Bank Smart Contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Use an Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to deposit Ether into the Piggy Bank.
3. Call the `withdraw` function to retrieve funds when needed (only the contract owner can do this).
